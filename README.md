ðŸ“„ Paper Overview
This research presents a lightweight and explainable machine learning framework for fault classification in electric vehicle (EV) drive motors. The framework integrates recursive feature selection, ensemble learning, parameter optimization, and explainable AI to enhance model performance while reducing computational complexity.

âœ¨ Key Highlights
Feature Selection: Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFE-CV)

Optimized Model: Soft Voting Classifier combining top-performing models

Explainability: Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)

Validation: Performance verified on both synthetic and real-world datasets

Efficiency: High diagnostic accuracy with minimal memory and inference cost.
